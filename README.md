# WP-Blocks
WP Blocks is basically a UI for creating content visually, and when you're done creating, all of the HTML is put in to 'the_content()' to be served to your visitors. This way, things are kept as lightweight as possible, and if you choose to move away from WP Blocks, then all of your content goes with you.
